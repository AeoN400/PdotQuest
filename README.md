# PdotQuest
This software is designed to analyze the long-term transit timing variations using both of a linear ephemeris model and a quadratic ephemeris model. 
This software allows for the efficient fitting of data by simply inputting a column of middle transit times, a column of transit time measurement uncertainties, as well as an initial orbital period corresponding to the earliest transit time. The best-fit results for the two ephemeris models can then be displayed and compared.
